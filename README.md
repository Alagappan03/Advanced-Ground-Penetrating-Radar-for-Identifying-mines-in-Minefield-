1.Pretraining with Grayscale Imagery

To enhance feature extraction, we pre-trained the initial layers of our CNN using grayscale images from the CIFAR-10 dataset before fine-tuning on GPR data.

2.CNN Training Process

The network parameters were optimized jointly using the Adam optimizer.

Training was conducted using mini-batches, ensuring efficient weight updates via backpropagation.

Multiple epochs were run to refine the network, with performance evaluation on a validation set to mitigate overfitting.

The model with the highest validation accuracy was selected for final testing.

3.Network Pretraining Strategy

We transferred up to four convolutional layers from the pre-trained CIFAR-10 model to initialize our GPR CNN, improving feature learning efficiency.

4.Data Augmentation for Robust Training

Vertical augmentation: Patches were extracted at intervals of one pixel, up to four pixels above and below the maximum keypoint location for threats.

Horizontal augmentation: Additional patches were selected two pixels away from the central keypoint.

Non-threat sampling: To balance the dataset, 33% of the non-threat samples were randomly drawn from three A-scansâ€”the central A-scan and one A-scan two pixels to the left and right.

5.CNN Architecture

While we took inspiration from the original paper, we adapted the CNN structure to suit our dataset.

Modifications included adjustments in the number of convolutional layers, kernel sizes, and activation functions to optimize performance for our specific GPR dataset.

Conclusion

Our approach successfully leveraged CNNs for buried threat detection, demonstrating the effectiveness of pretraining and data augmentation strategies. The modifications to the architecture helped improve accuracy and generalization, paving the way for further advancements in GPR-based threat detection systems.
